# Description

For Assignment 2, I created visualizations with the "penglings" data set using ggplot (in R), d3 (in Javascript), altair (in Python), Excel, DataWrapper, Tableau, and Flourish.

## ggplot

Using "ggplot" to make this plot was the default tool for me and I used the above plot as a reference when I made the other visualizations. I use *R* regularly and teach my students in introductory statistics how to use *R*, including how to make basic plots with the "ggplot2" library. Since I have years of experience with using *R*, I found making this plot easy to do and had existing code I could use as a template for making this plot. One of the reasons I teach this library to my students, rather than just have them use the default plotting tools in R (e.g., "plot" and "hist") is because I like the logic of "ggplot" syntax, with the first line calling the data and laying out what variables within the data you are plotting, then "building" the plot with the corresponding lines.

## d3

This one was a doozy... Despite having the "d3" library to use, I felt it was too complicated. To make such a basic plot required much *much* more code than I use in "ggplot." Needing to create variables for every aspect of the plot (e.g., axes) did not make me interested in using this tool again to make this type of plot. Perhaps there is a use for this tool when making visualizations like these, but, having used "ggplot" for years, I do not see how "d3" could be a *better* option than *R* for basic plotting. While I did not explore all the possible options with "d3," there may be more flexibility than "ggplot," but I would only consider using this tool if I had to make a complex visualization.
